# The Chicken Bar 

## Introduction

Welcome to The Chicken Bar website, where our entire menu (Monday through Friday) is dedicated to the delectable world of chicken. However, on Sundays, we switch things up and proudly serve a tantalizing array of mixed grilled meats. 

This site is specifically targeted toward chicken and meat lovers, who will find a unique and special dish on offer every day. 

They can order their favorite dishes online and pick them up within 15 minutes of placing their order.

## Project Goals

Our goal is not just to create another website. 

We want to elevate the online chicken cuisine experience to new heights. It's not just about the bread, chicken, sauces, and vegetables. It's the perfect blend of these elements that promises a truly unique and delightful taste experience.

We want our visitors to be able to almost smell and taste our dishes while browsing our site. 

When you're hungry, you want food right away, ordering food online should be easy, quick, and secure.

## Target Audience

- who appreciate high-quality, flavorful meat dishes.

- Time-strapped families seeking practical, healthy, and budget-friendly meal solutions for quick lunches or dinners mid-week or on weekend outings.

- Couples seeking a romantic ambiance for a special lunch or dinner.

- Busy professionals on the go who desire a quick and healthy lunch option during their limited lunch break.
